# FCFS Disk Scheduling Algorithm

This Java program implements the First-Come, First-Serve (FCFS) disk scheduling algorithm.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Java installed on your machine.
2. Compile the Java file using the command: `javac FCFS.java`
3. Run the compiled Java program using the command: `java FCFS`

## Input

The program will prompt you for the following inputs:

- The maximum range of the disk.
- The size of the queue request.
- The queue of disk positions to be read.
- The initial head position.

## Output

The program will output the movement of the disk head and the seek time for each movement. It will also output the total seek time and the average seek time.

## Note

The disk positions entered should be within the range of the disk. If an invalid position is entered, the program will prompt you to enter a valid position.
